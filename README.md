# Supervised-Learning

The Repository has code for the Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Network for Supervised Classification of the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. 

1) The Logistic Regression has been implemented from the scratch without the use of sklearn library as the requirement of the project 
2) The Neural Network is implemented with use of the default Python Library


The accuracy of the supervised model is calculated after predicting.
